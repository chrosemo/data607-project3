The extract_words function will take a link to a particular job post and the selector which contains the list of interest and return a dataframe of words in that job post's skills section and the number of occurences of each particular words.

```{r}
extract_words <- function(link_to_job_page, selector) {
  # download the html and turn it into an XML file with read_html()
  job_page <- read_html(link_to_job_page)
  # extract specific nodes with html_nodes() using css selector
  skills_tag <- html_nodes(job_page, selector)
  # extract content from nodes
  skills_text <- html_text(skills_tag)
  # remove punctuation
  skills_text <- gsub('[[:punct:]]', '', skills_text)
  # split sentences into individual words
  words <- unlist(strsplit(skills_text, " "))
  words <- tolower(words)
  # count the number of occurences of each word
  wordcount <- table(words)
  wordcount_df <- as.data.frame(wordcount)
  return(wordcount_df)
}
```

Given a list of links to job pages, call the extract_words function to get the total word counts from the chosen selector from each each link, aggregate them and return the counts in decreasing order in a data frame.

```{r}
get_word_counts <- function(links_to_jobs, selector) {
  
  # initialize a list 
  counts <- list()
  
  for (i in 1:length(links_to_jobs)) {
    df <- extract_words(links_to_jobs[i], selector)
    counts[[i]] <- df
  }
  # combine into a dataframe
  skill_count <- do.call(rbind, counts)
  
  # sum multiple occurences of the same word
  total_skill_count <- skill_count %>% 
    group_by(words) %>% 
    summarize(Occurences = sum(Freq)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(Occurences ))
  return(total_skill_count)
}
```

A function that applies the whitelist of data science key words and skills to our count of word occurences to filter our irrelevant words.

```{r}
get_DS_skills <- function(word_count) {
  # apply whitelist
  total_skill_count <- word_count %>% filter(words %in% wlist$Whitelist)
  return(total_skill_count)
}
```

## Extracting Data Science Skills from Linkedin

```{r}
linkedin_top_skills <- function() {
  # save the url which contains the search results
  rooturl <- "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/data-scientist-jobs/"
  # for each job, extract the href attribute from each job using the css selector
  search_results <- read_html(rooturl)
  links_to_jobs <- search_results %>% 
    html_nodes("a.result-card__full-card-link") %>% 
    html_attr("href")

  # for Linkedin job posts, skills are located in <li> tags with the following selector
  selector <- ".description__text--rich li"
  # get word counts from the list of links to job posts
  word_count <- get_word_counts(links_to_jobs, selector)
  
  # uncomment this to see the results pre-whitelist
  print(word_count)
  
  # get data science related skills from the above word count
  skill_count <- get_DS_skills(word_count)
  return(skill_count)
}
```

## Extracting Data Science Skills from Indeed

```{r}
indeed_top_skills <- function() {
  # save the url which contains the search results
  domain <- "https://www.indeed.com"
  rooturl <- "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=data+science&l=New+York+City%2C+NY"
  # for each job, extract the href attribute from each job using the css selector
  search_results <- read_html(rooturl)
 
  # create a list of links by extracting the href attribute from the nodes
  paths_to_jobs <- search_results %>%
    html_nodes(".title") %>%
    html_children() %>%
    html_attr("href")
  
  # contatenate paths with the domain name to create valid links
  links_to_jobs <- str_c(domain, paths_to_jobs)
  
  # for Indeed job posts, skills are located in <li> tags so the selector is simple
  selector <- "li"
  # get word counts from the list of links to job posts
  word_count <- get_word_counts(links_to_jobs, selector)
  
  # uncomment this to see the results pre-whitelist
  print(word_count)
  
  # get data science related skills from the above word count
  skill_count <- get_DS_skills(word_count)
  return(skill_count)
}
```
